# Anilist Unwatched

A very basic program that lists unwatched sequels/side stories of *animes* on a given AniList profile.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo, and go to the directory
2. Run `nix-shell` on Nix, or install python3 and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python main.py <username>` (append the `-s`/`--side-stories` flag if you also want to see side stories)
